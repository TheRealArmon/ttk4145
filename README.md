TTK4145 - Elevator project
==============================

In this project we have used Golang to create software for controlling 3 elevators working in parallell to service 4 floors. By using UDP broadcasting we have made the elevators communicate over a network, such that by using the information from all the elevators we have been able to find the best suited one to handle each order.
